## Description


Woke is a social network for social justice-minded individuals. It is specifically intended for college student groups to organize movements. It has all the standard features of a social network (search, profiles, organizations, newsfeeds, etc.) though it is no longer hosted for public access.


## About the Project


This repository contains the web files for Woke. I wrote Woke in 2016 with three other USC students as a part of Jefferey Miller's CSCI201 course.


## Technical Details


Woke was written in Java as per the project specification and utilizes Java Server Pages (JSP) for the web content. We used an apache tomcat server on the backend and leveraged glassfish for realtime user updates along with standard HTML, CSS, & JS web technologies.
